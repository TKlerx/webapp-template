# API Contract Changes: Auth Security Hardening

**Feature**: 010-auth-security-hardening | **Date**: 2026-04-01

This feature modifies the behavior of existing API endpoints. No new endpoints are added.

## Modified Endpoints

### POST /api/auth/login

**Change**: Add rate limiting (5 attempts / 15 min per IP) and audit logging.

**New response** (when rate-limited):
```
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: <seconds>

{
  "error": "Too many login attempts. Please try again later."
}
```

**Existing responses unchanged**:
- 200: Successful login (now also creates `AUTH_LOGIN_SUCCEEDED` audit entry)
- 401: Invalid credentials (now also creates `AUTH_LOGIN_REJECTED` audit entry)
- 403: Account deactivated (unchanged)

---

### POST /api/auth/change-password

**Change**: Add rate limiting (5 attempts / 15 min per IP) and audit logging.

{
  "error": "Too many attempts. Please try again later."
}
```

## Rate Limit Headers

All rate-limited responses include:
- `Retry-After`: Seconds until the client can retry (integer)

## Audit Entry Schema

All audit entries follow the existing `AuditEntry` model:

```json
{
  "action": "AUTH_LOGIN_SUCCEEDED | AUTH_LOGIN_REJECTED | AUTH_LOGOUT_SUCCEEDED | AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED | USER_CREATED | USER_STATUS_CHANGED | ROLE_CHANGED",
  "entityType": "User",
  "entityId": "<target user ID>",
  "actorId": "<acting user ID>",
  "details": "{ ... action-specific JSON ... }",
  "createdAt": "<ISO timestamp>"
}
```

### Details field by action

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| AUTH_LOGIN_SUCCEEDED | `{ "method": "password" }` |
| AUTH_LOGIN_REJECTED | `{ "reason": "invalid_credentials" \| "rate_limited" \| "inactive_account" }` |
| AUTH_LOGOUT_SUCCEEDED | `{}` |
| AUTH_PASSWORD_CHANGED | `{}` |
| USER_CREATED | `{ "role": "<role>", "authMethod": "LOCAL" }` |
| USER_STATUS_CHANGED | `{ "from": "<old_status>", "to": "<new_status>" }` |
| ROLE_CHANGED | `{ "from": "<old_role>", "to": "<new_role>" }` |
