# Auth & Security Review Checklist

## Review Snapshot (2026-04-01)

This file is a dated review copy of `AUTH_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`. The original checklist was left unchanged.

### Findings

1. High: There is still no rate limiting or lockout protection on either the login or password-change endpoints. The login route accepts repeated credential attempts with no throttling at [src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts#L8), and the password-change route likewise has no abuse control at [src/app/api/auth/change-password/route.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/app/api/auth/change-password/route.ts#L8). A repo-wide search found no rate-limit implementation in `src/`.

2. High: Proxy/origin handling trusts forwarded host and proto headers unconditionally. Better Auth enables `trustedProxyHeaders: true` at [src/lib/better-auth.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/lib/better-auth.ts#L52), and `getExternalOrigin` will trust `x-forwarded-host` / `x-forwarded-proto` whenever `AUTH_BASE_URL` is unset at [src/lib/azure-auth.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/lib/azure-auth.ts#L17). That creates avoidable host-header / callback-origin risk in misconfigured or direct deployments.

3. High: The `id_token` fallback path still decodes JWT payload claims without any signature validation. When Microsoft Graph userinfo fails, `fetchAzureUserProfile` falls back to `decodeJwtPayload(idToken)` at [src/lib/azure-auth.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/lib/azure-auth.ts#L124) and consumes those claims at [src/lib/azure-auth.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/lib/azure-auth.ts#L149). That matches the checklistâ€™s explicit â€œknown gapâ€ item and remains a real security weakness.

4. Medium: Login still leaks account existence through different execution paths and timing. Unknown emails return immediately after `prisma.user.findUnique` at [src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts#L19), while existing emails continue into Better Auth password verification at [src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts#L31). The error text is generic, but the timing difference is still observable.

5. Medium: `GET /api/users` still passes the `status` query parameter directly to Prisma without enum validation. The cast happens at [src/app/api/users/route.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/app/api/users/route.ts#L17), and the unvalidated value is used in the query at [src/app/api/users/route.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/app/api/users/route.ts#L19). An invalid status can therefore turn into a server error instead of a clean `400`.

6. Medium: Audit hooks exist but are not actually used for auth and user-admin events. The logging helper is defined at [src/lib/audit.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/lib/audit.ts#L13), but the only `logAudit(` reference in `src/` is that definition itself. That means the checklist items for successful/failed logins, password changes, role changes, and user status changes are currently unmet.

7. Low: The seed path still hashes whatever `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is provided without enforcing the same server-side complexity policy used elsewhere. The seed reads env vars at [prisma/seed.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/prisma/seed.ts#L15) and hashes directly at [prisma/seed.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/prisma/seed.ts#L37), but does not call `validatePasswordComplexity`.

### Verified Strengths

- Production startup rejects a missing or fallback auth secret at [src/lib/better-auth.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/lib/better-auth.ts#L33).
- Password hashing uses bcrypt with cost 12 at [src/lib/auth.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/lib/auth.ts#L13).
- Password change revokes other active sessions at [src/app/api/auth/change-password/route.ts](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/app/api/auth/change-password/route.ts#L70).
- Protected dashboard pages enforce server-side auth via `requireSession()` at [src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx](C:/dev/webapp-template/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx#L12).
- `.env` files and SQLite databases are ignored in [.gitignore](C:/dev/webapp-template/.gitignore#L12) and [.gitignore](C:/dev/webapp-template/.gitignore#L16).

### Scope Note

This review focused on the current codebase behavior and the highest-signal checklist items. The checklist body below remains as the original reference text.

Execute each item against the codebase. Mark pass/fail and note the file:line where you verified it.
Sections 1-10 focus on auth flow correctness. Sections 11-21 cover broader application security.

## 1. Secret Management

- [ ] Production crashes or refuses to start if the auth secret is missing or is the development fallback
- [ ] Auth secret is never logged, serialized to JSON responses, or exposed in client bundles
- [ ] No secrets (API keys, client secrets, passwords) are hardcoded outside of `.env*` files or test fixtures
- [ ] `.env` files are listed in `.gitignore`

## 2. Password Hashing

- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (or argon2/scrypt) with a cost factor >= 10
- [ ] Plain-text passwords are never stored in the database
- [ ] Plain-text passwords are never logged or included in API responses
- [ ] Password verification uses constant-time comparison (bcrypt.compare or equivalent)

## 3. Password Policy

- [ ] Minimum length >= 8 characters is enforced server-side
- [ ] Complexity rules (uppercase, lowercase, digit) are enforced server-side
- [ ] Password complexity is validated on all paths that set a password (user creation, password change, seed)
- [ ] New password !== current password is checked (optional but recommended)

## 4. Session Management

- [ ] Sessions are stored server-side (database), not solely in JWTs or client-side storage
- [ ] Session tokens are cryptographically random and sufficiently long
- [ ] Session cookies use `HttpOnly`, `Secure` (on HTTPS), and `SameSite` attributes
- [ ] Cookie path is scoped appropriately (not wider than necessary)
- [ ] Sessions have an expiration time
- [ ] Inactive/deactivated users are treated as unauthenticated even if they hold a valid session token
- [ ] Password change revokes all other active sessions for that user
- [ ] Logout destroys the session server-side (not just clearing the cookie)

## 5. Authentication Endpoints

- [ ] Login rejects missing or empty credentials with a 400
- [ ] Login returns a generic error for wrong email or wrong password (no user enumeration)
- [ ] Login rejects INACTIVE users with a clear message and does not create a session
- [ ] Login does not leak whether the email exists via timing or error message differences
- [ ] Self-service signup is disabled (if intended) â€” no public registration endpoint
- [ ] SSO initiation verifies that SSO is properly configured before redirecting
- [ ] SSO callback validates the OAuth state parameter to prevent CSRF (security)
- [ ] SSO callback handles token exchange errors gracefully without leaking internal details

## 6. Authorization / Route Protection

- [ ] All dashboard/protected pages enforce authentication server-side (not just client-side redirects)
- [ ] PENDING_APPROVAL users are redirected to a holding page, not the dashboard
- [ ] All admin API endpoints enforce role checks (PLATFORM_ADMIN or equivalent)
- [ ] Role checks use server-side enforcement, not just UI visibility
- [ ] Scope-restricted endpoints verify scope access for non-admin users
- [ ] API endpoints return 401 for unauthenticated requests
- [ ] API endpoints return 403 for authenticated but unauthorized requests
- [ ] Status codes are used consistently (401 = not authenticated, 403 = not authorized, 400 = bad input)
- [ ] Error messages across routes are consistent and do not leak internal details

## 7. Enum / Input Validation

- [ ] Role values are validated against the enum before being persisted (not just trusted from the request body)
- [ ] Status values are validated against the enum before being persisted
- [ ] Theme preference values are validated against the enum before being persisted
- [ ] Email addresses are lowercased consistently on all write paths (creation, login, SSO provisioning, credential lookup)
- [ ] Request bodies are typed and checked for required fields before use

## 8. User Lifecycle

- [ ] Admin-created users start with `mustChangePassword = true`
- [ ] SSO-provisioned users start with `status = PENDING_APPROVAL`
- [ ] The last PLATFORM_ADMIN cannot be deactivated
- [ ] The last PLATFORM_ADMIN cannot have their role downgraded
- [ ] Approve only works on PENDING_APPROVAL users
- [ ] Reactivate only works on INACTIVE users
- [ ] Deactivate revokes the user's active sessions (or the next session check treats them as unauthenticated)
- [ ] Auth method is updated to BOTH when a user authenticates via a second method

## 9. SSO / OAuth Specifics

- [ ] OAuth state parameter is generated with a CSPRNG
- [ ] OAuth state is validated on callback before exchanging the code
- [ ] Redirect URIs are constructed from server-side config, not from user input
- [ ] Token exchange uses `cache: "no-store"` or equivalent to prevent caching secrets
- [ ] The id_token fallback (when userinfo fails) does not trust the token without verifying the signature (security - note if this is a known gap)
- [ ] Mock/test SSO paths are gated behind an environment variable and cannot be triggered in production

## 10. Seed / Initial Setup

- [ ] Seed requires env vars for the initial admin credentials (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Seed is idempotent â€” does not create duplicates on re-run
- [ ] Seeded admin has `mustChangePassword = true`
- [ ] Seeded credential account uses the same hashing as the rest of the app

## 11. Cookie / Header Security (security)

- [ ] Auth cookies use a `__Secure-` prefix when served over HTTPS
- [ ] `X-Forwarded-Host` / `X-Forwarded-Proto` are only trusted when explicitly configured (reverse proxy)
- [ ] CORS is not overly permissive on auth endpoints
- [ ] `Set-Cookie` headers from the auth library are forwarded correctly through custom response wrappers

## 12. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention (security)

- [ ] Login endpoint has rate limiting or account lockout after repeated failures
- [ ] Password change endpoint has rate limiting
- [ ] SSO initiation cannot be used for open-redirect abuse (redirect targets are validated)

## 13. Logging and Audit (security)

- [ ] Failed login attempts are logged or recorded in an audit trail
- [ ] Successful logins are logged or recorded
- [ ] Password changes are logged
- [ ] Role changes are logged
- [ ] User status changes (approve, deactivate, reactivate) are logged
- [ ] Logs do not contain passwords, tokens, or session secrets

## 14. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- [ ] All user-supplied data rendered in HTML is escaped by the framework (React/JSX auto-escaping)
- [ ] No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- [ ] URL parameters displayed in the UI (e.g., `searchParams.get("error")`) are rendered as text, not injected as raw HTML
- [ ] User-supplied values are never interpolated into `<script>` tags or inline event handlers
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy header is set and restricts `script-src` (ideally no `unsafe-inline`)
- [ ] SVG uploads or user-provided image URLs are not rendered in a way that allows embedded scripts

## 15. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- [ ] State-changing endpoints (POST, PATCH, DELETE) are not triggered by simple GET requests
- [ ] Auth cookies use `SameSite=Lax` or `SameSite=Strict`
- [ ] OAuth flows use a state parameter validated on callback (also in section 9)
- [ ] Logout form uses POST, not a GET link
- [ ] If custom CSRF tokens are used, they are validated server-side on every state-changing request

## 16. SQL Injection / Query Safety

- [ ] All database queries use parameterized queries or the ORM's query builder (no raw string concatenation)
- [ ] Any use of `$queryRaw` or `$executeRaw` in Prisma uses tagged template literals (parameterized), not string interpolation
- [ ] User input used in `where` clauses is passed through ORM methods, never concatenated into query strings
- [ ] The `status` query parameter in `GET /api/users` is validated against the enum before being passed to Prisma (or Prisma rejects invalid values safely)

## 17. Input Validation and Sanitization

- [ ] All API endpoints validate and reject unexpected or malformed request bodies
- [ ] File uploads (if any) validate file type, size, and content â€” not just the extension
- [ ] Numeric inputs are parsed and range-checked (no unbounded values passed to queries or allocations)
- [ ] String inputs that end up in URLs, redirects, or headers are validated to prevent injection (CRLF, open redirect)
- [ ] JSON parsing errors are caught and return 400, not 500 with a stack trace
- [ ] Query parameters used for filtering (e.g., `status`, `scopeId`) are validated against allowed values

## 18. HTTP Header Hardening

- [ ] `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) header is set in production
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header is set
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` is set (or equivalent CSP `frame-ancestors`)
- [ ] `Referrer-Policy` is set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` or stricter
- [ ] `Permissions-Policy` restricts unnecessary browser features (camera, microphone, geolocation)
- [ ] Server version headers (`X-Powered-By`, `Server`) are suppressed or removed
- [ ] CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is not set to `*` on authenticated endpoints
- [ ] CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is only used with specific origins, never with `*`

## 19. Dependency Security

- [ ] No known critical/high CVEs in direct dependencies (`npm audit` or equivalent)
- [ ] Lock file (`package-lock.json` or equivalent) is committed and used for deterministic installs
- [ ] Dependencies are reasonably up to date (especially security-sensitive ones: auth libraries, crypto, ORM)
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies that increase attack surface
- [ ] Dev dependencies are not bundled into the production build

## 20. Error Handling and Information Leakage

- [ ] Stack traces are never returned in API responses in production
- [ ] Database errors are caught and return generic messages, not raw Prisma/SQL errors
- [ ] 500 errors return a generic message without internal details
- [ ] Error responses have a consistent shape across all endpoints (e.g., `{ error: string }`)
- [ ] Debug or verbose logging is disabled in production
- [ ] Environment variables and config values are never included in error responses
- [ ] The `/api/auth/callback/[provider]` catch-all does not forward raw provider errors to the client

## 21. Sensitive Data Exposure

- [ ] API responses never include password hashes, tokens, or session secrets
- [ ] User listing endpoints return only necessary fields (no password, no internal IDs that leak sequence info)
- [ ] The session endpoint does not return more user data than the client needs
- [ ] Database backups and dev.db files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `console.log` statements in production code do not output sensitive request bodies or auth tokens
- [ ] Prisma query results are mapped to response shapes â€” full model objects are not returned directly
- [ ] Access tokens and refresh tokens from OAuth providers are not exposed to the client

## 22. Open Redirect

- [ ] Redirect targets after login are validated against an allowlist or restricted to relative paths
- [ ] The `redirectTo` field in login responses cannot be set to an arbitrary external URL by the client
- [ ] SSO callback redirect targets are server-controlled, not taken from query parameters
- [ ] The `callbackURL` passed to Better Auth `signInSocial` is constructed server-side

## 23. File System and Server Configuration

- [ ] The `public/` directory does not contain sensitive files (backups, config, source maps in production)
- [ ] Source maps are not deployed to production (or are restricted to authenticated error reporting)
- [ ] `.env`, `.env.local`, and similar files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] The Prisma SQLite dev database (`dev.db`) is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No temporary or generated files are committed that could contain secrets
- [ ] `next.config` does not expose internal paths or rewrites that bypass auth

## 24. API Design and Miscellaneous

- [ ] DELETE and destructive PATCH endpoints require appropriate authorization
- [ ] Bulk endpoints (list users, export audit) have pagination or result limits to prevent DoS
- [ ] Large response payloads are bounded (no unbounded `findMany` without `take`/`limit`)
- [ ] Timestamps in responses use a consistent format (ISO 8601)
- [ ] API versioning or stability expectations are documented if the API is consumed externally
- [ ] The `[provider]` dynamic route segment in the auth callback cannot be abused to proxy requests to arbitrary OAuth providers not configured in Better Auth

## How to Use This Checklist

1. For each item, search the codebase for the relevant code path.
2. Mark `[x]` if the behavior is verified, `[-]` if not applicable, or leave `[ ]` if it fails.
3. For failures, note the file and line, and whether it is a bug, a missing feature, or an accepted risk.
4. Sections 1-10 cover auth flow correctness. Sections 11-24 cover broader application security.
5. Some items overlap intentionally (e.g., CSRF state validation appears in both auth and CSRF sections) to ensure coverage regardless of which section the reviewer starts with.
