# Implementation Plan: API Route Refactor

**Branch**: `011-route-refactor` | **Date**: 2026-04-01 | **Spec**: `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\specs\011-route-refactor\spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\specs\011-route-refactor\spec.md`

**Required First Step**: Read `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\CONTINUE.md` before planning or implementation so the current handoff context, open risks, and recommended next actions are carried forward. Completed during planning.

## Summary

Refactor the current Next.js App Router API handlers so repeated authorization, managed-user loading, audit filter parsing, and small route orchestration steps move into app-level shared services under `src/services`, while preserving every existing endpoint contract. This plan focuses only on the route families that currently exist and are intentionally in scope in this starter: users, audit, background jobs, and authenticated auth routes.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9 on Next.js 16 App Router (React 19)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 16, React 19, Prisma 7, Better Auth, Zod, Vitest, Playwright, jscpd  
**Storage**: Prisma with SQLite for local development and PostgreSQL for Docker/shared deployments  
**Testing**: Vitest unit tests, Playwright E2E tests, `validate.ps1` quality gate (`typecheck`, `lint`, `duplication`, `semgrep`, tests)  
**Target Platform**: Node.js-hosted Next.js web application with browser clients and App Router API endpoints  
**Project Type**: Web application  
**Performance Goals**: No material latency regression for existing API routes; avoid adding extra database round-trips unless a shared helper replaces duplicate work overall  
**Constraints**: Preserve exact status codes, response shapes, and current error messages; keep route entrypoints readable; place new shared orchestration in `src/services`; keep repo duplication under the existing 3% jscpd threshold or document intentional route-entrypoint exceptions; do not invent schema changes for domain models that are absent from the current starter  
**Scale/Scope**: Single application, 18 current API route files under `src/app/api`, single-instance deployment, ~10 users per constitution

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Simplicity First | PASS | Plan uses thin route handlers plus narrow service helpers; no generic middleware DSL or framework abstraction layer. |
| II. Test Coverage | PASS | Implementation will keep existing route tests passing, add helper-focused unit coverage where extraction introduces risk, and run `validate.ps1 all` before merge. |
| III. Duplication Control | PASS | Local jscpd on `src/app/api` currently reports 5.74% duplication, especially in user status and audit routes; these are the first refactor targets and the duplication policy is documented in `research.md` and `contracts/`. |
| IV. Incremental Delivery | PASS | Increments are ordered by business value and risk: user-admin route helpers first, then audit/background-job helpers, then auth-route cleanup. |
| V. Spec Sequencing And Completion | PASS WITH USER-CONFIRMED OVERRIDE | `specs/OVERVIEW.md` marks `010-auth-security-hardening` as fully implemented, but the active branch and `CONTINUE.md` still reference `010`. The user explicitly requested planning for `011-route-refactor` on 2026-04-01, so this newer-spec planning proceeds with that confirmation recorded here. |
| VI. Continuity And Handoff | PASS WITH FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED | `CONTINUE.md` lists `010` and `011` as active while `ACTIVE_SPECS.md` says none. Planning can proceed, but implementation should reconcile continuity tracking before coding/merge. |
| VII. Azure OpenAI Integration | PASS | No provider changes are planned. The spec's AI orchestration examples are documented as future extension points only because no AI routes exist in this starter. |
| VIII.-X. Web/App Standards | PASS | This is an internal API refactor; route behavior remains unchanged and existing base-path, i18n, and responsive UI constraints are unaffected. |

**Gate Result (Pre-Phase 0)**: PASS for planning. No unresolved clarifications remain. Continuity file reconciliation is a required follow-up before implementation is considered complete.

**Structure Decision**: Keep the existing single Next.js application layout. Shared route orchestration will move into `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\src\services\api\...`, while lower-level utilities that are not route-specific remain in `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\src\lib\...`. Route files under `src/app/api` stay as thin entrypoints that parse HTTP input and preserve endpoint-specific response contracts.

## Phase 0 Research Outcome

Research output is documented in `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\specs\011-route-refactor\research.md`.

Key decisions:

- Introduce a dedicated `src/services/api` layer for route orchestration rather than expanding `src/lib`.
- Refactor the current duplication hotspots first: user status routes and audit query parsing/export filters.
- Preserve the existing `{ error: Response } | { ... }` short-circuit pattern for authorization helpers to minimize route churn.
- Treat document-version mutation and AI enqueue flows as future contract placeholders because the current starter has no matching routes or Prisma models.
- Keep route-entrypoint boilerplate acceptable only for HTTP export wiring, request parsing, and final response shaping; repeated business logic must move to services.

## Phase 1 Design Outputs

Design artifacts produced for this plan:

- `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\specs\011-route-refactor\data-model.md`
- `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\specs\011-route-refactor\contracts\api-invariants.md`
- `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\specs\011-route-refactor\contracts\service-boundaries.md`
- `C:\dev\gvi-finance-starter\specs\011-route-refactor\quickstart.md`

Planned design shape:

1. Shared route context helpers
   `requireRouteUser`, admin-only context loaders, and managed-user lookup helpers remain narrow and route-oriented.
2. Shared orchestration services
   User status mutations, audit filter parsing, and background-job request handling become service calls so route handlers mostly coordinate HTTP semantics.
3. Contract preservation
   Response payloads, status codes, and current error-message text stay route-owned and unchanged.

## Post-Design Constitution Check

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Simplicity First | PASS | Design keeps services small and domain-specific; no speculative generic router framework is introduced. |
| Test Coverage | PASS | Quickstart and contracts call for existing route regression tests plus new service tests where behavior is extracted. |
| Duplication Control | PASS | Design addresses the measured jscpd hotspots and documents acceptable residual route duplication. |
| Incremental Delivery | PASS | The plan still supports story-by-story implementation without broad cross-cutting rewrites. |
| Spec Sequencing / Continuity | PASS WITH FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED | The explicit user request for `011` is recorded, but repo continuity files still need reconciliation before implementation is wrapped. |

**Gate Result (Post-Phase 1)**: PASS for design completion. The only non-feature follow-up is continuity-file cleanup before or alongside implementation.

## Phase 2 Implementation Preview

1. Increment 1 (P1)
   Extract admin/user route context helpers and consolidate the `approve`, `deactivate`, `reactivate`, `role`, and `theme` route families without changing responses.
2. Increment 2 (P1 support)
   Extract shared audit filter parsing and background-job request helpers, keeping route-specific export/list behavior intact.
3. Increment 3 (cleanup)
   Apply the same thin-route pattern to auth routes where duplication remains behaviorally sensitive and covered by existing tests.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Newer spec planned while repo continuity still references `010` | User explicitly requested `011-route-refactor` planning on 2026-04-01 | Waiting for continuity cleanup would block requested planning work even though `specs/OVERVIEW.md` already marks `010` complete |
