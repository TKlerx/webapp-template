Purpose: Track the status of all planned features, their implementation progress, and next steps.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning | Expected Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planned | The feature intent is captured, but no clarification work has been recorded yet. | `spec.md` only |
| Clarified | The open scope and decision questions have been resolved. | `spec.md` + `clarify.md` |
| Analyzed | The feature has been researched enough to support planning. | `spec.md` + `clarify.md` + `research.md` |
| Tasked | The feature has a concrete execution plan and task list, but no implementation tasks are checked yet. | `spec.md` + `clarify.md` + `research.md` + `plan.md` + `data-model.md` + `tasks.md` |
| In Progress | Implementation has started and some tasks are checked. | `tasks.md` exists and some tasks are checked |
| Partially Implemented | Core work appears implemented, but tasks remain unchecked. | Major stories implemented, but tasks remain unchecked |
| Fully Implemented | All tasks are checked and validation/testing is recorded as complete. | All tasks checked and validation/testing noted as complete |
