# Feature Specification: Shared Mailbox Notifications

**Feature Branch**: `014-shared-mailbox-notifications`  
**Created**: 2026-04-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Send and receive emails using a shared mailbox (Microsoft 365) for sending notification emails when application events occur (role changes, approvals, task assignments) and receiving/processing incoming emails. Integrates with existing auth and RBAC system."

> Before drafting or implementing this feature, review `/CONTINUE.md` for the latest handoff context and current recommended next steps.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automatic Event Notifications (Priority: P1)

When significant events happen in the application (e.g., a user's role is changed, a new user is created, a user status changes), the system automatically sends a notification email from the shared mailbox to the affected user and relevant administrators.

**Why this priority**: Notification emails are the primary use case. They keep users informed about important account and workflow changes without requiring them to be logged in, reducing confusion and support burden.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering a role change for a user and verifying that the affected user and the relevant admin(s) receive a notification email from the shared mailbox address.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user exists with a valid email, **When** an admin changes their role, **Then** the user receives a notification email describing the change, sent from the shared mailbox address.
2. **Given** a new user account is created, **When** the creation is finalized, **Then** the new user receives a welcome/approval-pending notification email.
3. **Given** a user's status changes (e.g., ACTIVE to INACTIVE), **When** the status change is saved, **Then** the user receives a notification email about their updated status.
4. **Given** the mail service is temporarily unavailable, **When** an event triggers a notification, **Then** the system retries delivery and logs the failure without blocking the original action.

### User Story 2 - Notification Preferences and Management (Priority: P2)

Administrators can view which notification types are enabled, review a log of sent notifications, and configure notification rules (e.g., which events trigger emails, who receives them). Users with appropriate roles can manage notification settings for their scope.

**Why this priority**: Without management capabilities, notifications become a black box. Admins need visibility into what is being sent and the ability to adjust notification behavior as organizational needs evolve.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as an admin, navigating to notification settings, toggling a notification type off, triggering the corresponding event, and verifying no email is sent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin is logged in, **When** they navigate to notification settings, **Then** they see a list of all notification event types with their current enabled/disabled status.
2. **Given** an admin disables a notification type, **When** the corresponding event occurs, **Then** no email is sent for that event type.
3. **Given** sent notifications exist, **When** an admin views the notification log, **Then** they see a chronological list with recipient, event type, timestamp, and delivery status.

### User Story 3 - Receive and Process Incoming Emails (Priority: P3)

The system can poll or receive emails sent to the shared mailbox and process them. For example, out-of-office replies or bounce-back messages are logged, and specific inbound email patterns (e.g., replies containing a ticket reference) can be parsed and routed to the appropriate area of the application.

**Why this priority**: Receiving emails is a secondary use case that builds on top of the sending capability. It enables two-way communication but is not required for the core notification value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending an email to the shared mailbox address, waiting for the polling interval, and verifying the email appears in the system's inbound log with correct metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an email is sent to the shared mailbox, **When** the system polls for new messages, **Then** the email is retrieved and stored with sender, subject, body preview, and timestamp.
2. **Given** a bounce-back email is received, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the corresponding notification is marked as undeliverable in the notification log.
3. **Given** an inbound email contains a recognized reference pattern, **When** processed, **Then** the email is linked to the relevant entity in the application.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has no email address on file? The notification is skipped and the event is logged with a warning.
- What happens when the shared mailbox credentials expire or are revoked? The system logs an authentication error, marks pending notifications as failed, and alerts platform administrators via an in-app notification.
- What happens when a notification email is sent but bounces? The bounce is captured via inbound processing (P3) and the notification record is updated.
- What happens when a high volume of events occurs simultaneously (e.g., bulk role changes)? Notifications are queued and sent with rate limiting to avoid throttling by the mail provider.
- What happens when the same event triggers multiple notification types? Each notification type is evaluated independently; duplicate emails to the same recipient for the same event are suppressed.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST send notification emails from a configured shared mailbox when designated application events occur.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support the following notification-triggering events at minimum: user created, role changed, user status changed, and scope assignment changed.
- **FR-003**: System MUST queue outbound emails and process them asynchronously so that the triggering action is never blocked by email delivery.
- **FR-004**: System MUST retry failed email deliveries with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts) before marking a notification as permanently failed.
- **FR-005**: System MUST log every outbound notification attempt with recipient, event type, timestamp, and delivery status (sent, failed, retrying).
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate with the shared mailbox using application-level credentials (client credentials flow), not individual user credentials.
- **FR-007**: Administrators (PLATFORM_ADMIN role) MUST be able to view a notification log showing all sent and failed notifications.
- **FR-008**: Administrators MUST be able to enable or disable individual notification event types.
- **FR-009**: System MUST support notification recipient rules: the affected user, the acting admin, and/or all users with a specific role, depending on event type.
- **FR-010**: Notification email content MUST be localized based on the recipient's preferred locale (using the existing i18n system with the 5 supported locales).
- **FR-011**: System MUST poll the shared mailbox for incoming emails at a configurable interval, handled by a separate worker process (the existing Python worker template) that runs independently from the main application.
- **FR-012**: System MUST parse inbound bounce/NDR messages and update the corresponding outbound notification status.
- **FR-013**: System MUST store shared mailbox connection settings (mailbox address, tenant, credentials) as server-side configuration, not editable through the UI.
- **FR-014**: System MUST respect RBAC: only PLATFORM_ADMIN can access notification management; SCOPE_ADMIN can view notification log entries within their scope.

### Key Entities

- **Notification Event**: A record of an application event that triggered (or should trigger) a notification. Key attributes: event type, triggering user, affected user, timestamp, related entity reference.
- **Notification**: An individual email message generated from an event. Key attributes: recipient, subject, body, locale, delivery status (queued/sent/failed/bounced), retry count, sent timestamp.
- **Notification Type Configuration**: A setting per event type controlling whether notifications are enabled and who the recipients are. Key attributes: event type, enabled flag, recipient rule.
- **Inbound Email**: A record of an email received in the shared mailbox. Key attributes: sender, subject, body preview, received timestamp, processing status, linked entity reference (if matched).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Notification emails for supported events are delivered to recipients within 2 minutes of the triggering action under normal operating conditions.
- **SC-002**: 99% of notification emails are successfully delivered on the first or second attempt (excluding permanent failures like invalid addresses).
- **SC-003**: Administrators can find any notification's delivery status within 3 clicks from the main navigation.
- **SC-004**: Notification emails render correctly in the recipient's preferred language for all 5 supported locales.
- **SC-005**: A failed mail service connection does not degrade or block any other application functionality.
- **SC-006**: Inbound emails sent to the shared mailbox are available in the system within one polling interval of receipt.

## Assumptions

- The shared mailbox is a Microsoft 365 shared mailbox, and the organization has an Azure AD app registration with Mail.Send and Mail.Read permissions available.
- Notification email templates will use plain, branded HTML suitable for common email clients (no complex interactive elements).
- The application already has user email addresses stored (via the existing user model) and locale preferences (via the i18n cookie/preference system).
- Rate limits imposed by the mail provider (Microsoft Graph API) are sufficient for the expected notification volume of this application.
- Inbound email processing is limited to structured parsing (bounce detection, reference matching) and does not require natural language understanding.
- A separate Python worker template already exists and will be used for the inbound email polling worker. The web application and the worker share the same database.
