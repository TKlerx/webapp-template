## 2026-06-20 09:45:41 +02:00

- Ported rag-agent-style supply-chain audit coverage into `webapp-template`.
- Added app and worker `dependency-audit` Docker targets for image-context `pnpm audit` and `uv audit` execution.
- Extended `scripts/supply-chain-audit.ps1` to combine existing pinned-Trivy runtime/config scans with app host/image dependency audits, worker image dependency audits, strict High/Critical blocking, and narrow exception matching from `supply-chain-audit-exceptions.json`.
- Documented audit exception records in `docs/security/audit-exceptions.md` and worker audit usage in `worker/README.md`.
- Validation passed:
  - `scripts/supply-chain-audit.ps1 -SkipBuild -SkipImageScans -SkipConfigScans -SkipDependencyAudits`
  - host `pnpm audit --prod --no-optional --json` parsing reports the existing moderate PostCSS advisory as non-blocking
  - `uv audit --no-dev` from `worker/`
- Docker-backed image-context audit validation was blocked locally because the Docker daemon is unavailable; rerun `pnpm run supply-chain:audit` when Docker is available.

## 2026-06-11 21:14:00

- Implemented ops health dashboard feature slices for spec `021-ops-health-dashboard`.
- Added admin `/admin/ops` page, `/api/admin/ops-health` snapshot API, shared ops health snapshot logic, localized UI, responsive e2e coverage, and safe copy diagnostics.
- Focused Vitest and Playwright ops-health checks pass; final validation remains.

## 2026-06-11 18:05:00

- Applied `/speckit.analyze` remediation edits for spec `021-ops-health-dashboard`.
- Tightened config sanity scope, copy toast feedback, safe fatal-error testing, and full pre-merge validation tasks.

## 2026-06-11 17:55:00

- Generated task list for spec `021-ops-health-dashboard`.
- Tasks cover setup, shared snapshot foundation, three independently testable user stories, and polish/validation.
- Next action: run `/speckit.implement`.

## 2026-06-11 17:40:00

- Planned spec `021-ops-health-dashboard`.
- Added `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/ops-health-dashboard.md`, and `quickstart.md`.
- Updated `ACTIVE_SPECS.md` and Codex agent context. Next action: run `/speckit.tasks`.

## 2026-06-11 17:24:00

- Clarified spec `021-ops-health-dashboard`.
- Decisions: admin-only access, admin/ops navigation, point-in-time snapshot with manual refresh, recent recorded worker/smoke status only, and copyable non-secret diagnostic summary.
- Next action: run `/speckit.plan`.

## 2026-06-11 17:09:00

- Created spec `021-ops-health-dashboard` on branch `021-ops-health-dashboard`.
- Added requirement checklist and refreshed `specs/OVERVIEW.md` plus `.specify/feature.json`.
- Kept prior continuity housekeeping changes for inclusion in the next PR, per user request.

## 2026-06-11 16:59:10

- Corrected continuity snapshot after PR #4 merge.
- Current state: clean `main`, runtime build metadata feature merged, local and GitHub validation green.
- Next recommendation: select the next user-visible feature area rather than adding more deployment plumbing immediately.

## 2026-05-28 09:15:49 +02:00

- Implemented spec `016-runtime-credential-separation` end to end.
- Added runtime credential ownership documentation and validation in `docs/runtime-credentials.md` and `scripts/validate-runtime-credentials.ps1`.
- Split production-style database URL ownership with `APP_DATABASE_URL`, `WORKER_DATABASE_URL`, and `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, while preserving `DATABASE_URL` as the local-development fallback.
- Refactored Docker Compose into common/app/migration/worker env blocks, keeping worker-owned Graph mail credentials out of the app runtime and documenting current Microsoft identity sharing exceptions.
- Updated app, Better Auth, migration seed, and worker config paths to honor runtime-specific database URLs.
- Verified with `pnpm run validate`, focused app/worker tests, and Docker Compose config using `.env.example` plus `.env.docker.example`.

## 2026-05-27 23:15:51 +02:00

- Compared this template with `../rag-agent` spec `026-runtime-least-privilege` and confirmed the route/auth helper separation is already present here through spec `011-route-refactor`.
- Added a smaller template-focused spec package under `specs/016-runtime-credential-separation/`.
- Scope covers app, worker, migration/provisioning, and local-development credential ownership; runtime-specific database URL variables; Compose env block separation; Graph/Teams secret ownership; and lightweight validation.
- Refreshed `specs/OVERVIEW.md` and pointed `.specify/feature.json` at the new spec.

## 2026-04-27 23:15:00

- Executed major implementation work for spec `015-teams-messaging-skeleton` on branch `015-teams-messaging-skeleton`.
- Added Teams data model support in both Prisma schemas plus checked-in SQLite/PostgreSQL migrations at `20260427090000_add_teams_messaging_skeleton`.
- Implemented Teams Graph client/types (`src/lib/teams`), admin/service/intake layers (`src/services/teams`), API routes under `/api/integrations/teams/*`, and a new admin page at `/admin/integrations/teams`.
- Extended worker runtime with `graph_teams.py`, Teams DB operations in `worker/src/starter_worker/db.py`, and new job handling/scheduling in `worker/src/starter_worker/main.py`.
- Added Teams i18n/navigation wiring and test coverage across unit/integration/worker suites; verified with `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, focused Vitest runs, and `uv run python -m unittest tests/test_main.py -v`.
- Updated `specs/015-teams-messaging-skeleton/tasks.md` to mark completed tasks; remaining unchecked task: `T038` (real quickstart runtime validation).

## 2026-04-27 23:32:00

- Added delegated OAuth consent support for Teams channel send-on-behalf behavior (to address delegated-only `ChannelMessage.Send` permission) via:
  - `src/services/teams/consent.ts`
  - `/api/integrations/teams/consent/start`
  - `/api/integrations/teams/consent/callback`
  - `/api/integrations/teams/consent/status`
- Added `TeamsDelegatedGrant` persistence in both Prisma schemas and checked-in migrations (`20260427103000_add_teams_delegated_grants` for SQLite/Postgres).
- Wired Teams outbound queue payloads to include fresh delegated access tokens when available, and updated worker Teams send path to prefer delegated bearer tokens.
- Updated Teams admin UI with consent status + connect button and appended spec clarifications in `specs/015-teams-messaging-skeleton/spec.md` for the delegated permission decision.

## 2026-04-23 00:00:00

- Created and switched to branch `015-teams-messaging-skeleton` for a new Microsoft Teams integration skeleton feature.
- Added specification artifacts under `specs/015-teams-messaging-skeleton/`, including a complete `spec.md` and quality checklist.
- Updated `.specify/feature.json` to point at `specs/015-teams-messaging-skeleton` and refreshed `specs/OVERVIEW.md` via the overview updater script.

## 2026-04-12 18:30:00

- Started spec `013-cli-client` on `main` and added it to `ACTIVE_SPECS.md` because the CLI work is not fully complete yet.
- Scaffolded a standalone Go CLI module under `cli/` with root command wiring, config storage, HTTP client/auth helpers, output renderers, command implementations, release config, and initial Go tests.
- Reconciled the CLI against the real server routes before implementing it, including the current `PATCH` user mutation endpoints and the split between `/api/audit` and `/api/audit/export`.
- Left the remaining spec tasks open where work is still partial or blocked by the missing Go toolchain, especially richer test coverage, final exit-code validation, and `go test` / `go vet`.

## 2026-04-12 19:05:00

- Installed Go support for the session and verified the CLI module with `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, and `go build ./...` from `cli/`.
- Fixed the issues that surfaced under real validation: added `go.sum`, corrected query-string preservation in the shared HTTP client, and updated the config permission test to respect Windows semantics.
- Expanded CLI test coverage for browser-login fallback and invalid-state handling, user mutation routes, forbidden/connection exit-code mapping, and audit export behavior.
- Switched the working branch from `main` to `013-cli-client` and reduced the remaining spec work to a single open item: the `gvi configure` success output still cannot print authenticated user identity cleanly without a suitable server endpoint.

## 2026-04-12 18:55:00

- Closed the final spec-013 gap by adding `/api/auth/me`, which reuses the existing shared session-or-token route auth and returns the authenticated user payload for PAT and CLI-token flows.
- Updated `gvi configure` to call both `/api/health` and `/api/auth/me`, then print the authenticated user name and role before finishing.
- Installed local Node dependencies, regenerated Prisma client artifacts, and verified the new web-side route with `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` plus `pnpm exec vitest run tests/integration/token-api.test.ts`.
- Re-ran `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` in `cli/`; spec `013-cli-client` is now fully complete and has been removed from `ACTIVE_SPECS.md`.

## 2026-04-10 10:45:00

- Implemented the concrete security actions for the background-jobs endpoint by requiring `PLATFORM_ADMIN` for job creation, allowlisting job types, and rejecting payloads larger than 10KB.
- Added a production seed guard for the default initial admin password and added Compose command guards that reject blank/default Postgres passwords in the production-style container flow.
- Updated the app runtime image to run as a non-root user and moved the Compose services onto an explicit internal network.
- Extended the background-jobs route unit tests and verified the full repo with `docker compose config`, the focused route test, and `./validate.ps1 full`.

## 2026-04-10 11:00:00

- Moved the security planning docs into `docs/security/` so they live in a clearer documentation subsection.
- Reworked the former `security-actions.md` note into a maintained action tracker with explicit completed and remaining sections.
- Updated continuity references to point at the new `docs/security/followups.md` and `docs/security/actions.md` locations.

## 2026-04-10 01:50:00

- Added `docs/security/followups.md` as a handoff note for the next security-focused session.
- Ranked the remaining realistic concerns by practical priority instead of mixing runtime, deploy-time, and operational issues together.
- Captured a suggested order for the next follow-up pass so work can resume quickly tomorrow.

## 2026-04-10 01:42:00

- Confirmed that Prisma CLI is not part of the shipped runtime image, but the Compose migration flow still needed it.
- Added a dedicated `migrate-runner` stage to `Dockerfile.app` and pointed the Compose `migrate` service at that stage, while keeping the `app` service on the lean `runner` stage.
- This keeps Prisma CLI available where deploy-time migrations need it without reintroducing dev tooling into the runtime app container.
- Verified with `docker compose config` plus `./validate.ps1 full`.

## 2026-04-10 01:24:00

- Added a retry badge to the background-jobs dashboard for `PENDING` jobs that are scheduled to retry after a previous failure.
- Kept the hint derived from the existing monitoring fields (`status`, `attemptCount`, `availableAt`, `updatedAt`, `error`) so no extra queue-specific metadata was needed.
- Added the new `backgroundJobs.retryScheduled` translation key across the locale files and updated the dashboard unit test to cover the retry hint.
- Verified with the focused background-jobs page unit test plus `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and `./validate.ps1 full`.

## 2026-04-10 01:35:00

- Kept the starter on the existing database-backed queue instead of introducing Redis, and hardened the Python worker with retry/backoff and stale-lock recovery.
- Added `WORKER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `WORKER_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS`, and `WORKER_STALE_LOCK_SECONDS` configuration, with retries remaining observable through the existing `BackgroundJob` fields used by the dashboard.
- Extended the worker test suite to cover retry scheduling, terminal failure after max attempts, and requeueing stale `IN_PROGRESS` jobs.
- Verified the change with `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_main` from `worker/`, plus `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and `./validate.ps1 full`.

## 2026-04-10 01:05:00

- Converted `CreateUserDialog` from an inline card form into a real shadcn dialog while keeping the surrounding page layout lightweight.
- Replaced the remaining native `<select>` controls in user management and locale switching with shadcn `Select`.
- Updated the affected Playwright user-management flow to open the dialog and interact with the shadcn combobox/option controls.
- Verified the migration with `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm test`, the focused Playwright user-management spec, and `./validate.ps1 full`.

## 2026-04-10 00:00:00

- Switched the existing `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` and `src/components/ui/Input.tsx` implementations to shadcn-backed compatibility wrappers.
- Preserved the current import surface and the existing `primary | secondary` button API so auth and dashboard code did not need a large import rewrite.
- Verified the wrapper migration with `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and `./validate.ps1 full`.

## 2026-04-09 20:17:00

- Added shadcn support to the starter without replacing the existing custom `src/components/ui` layer.
- Created `components.json` so shadcn-generated components target `src/components/shadcn`, avoiding Windows case-insensitive filename conflicts with `Button.tsx` and `Input.tsx`.
- Added `src/lib/utils.ts`, extended the global theme tokens, and installed a starter shadcn component set for forms, dialogs, tables, and layout primitives.
- Declared the required shadcn runtime dependencies and verified the repo with `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and `./validate.ps1 full`.

## 2026-03-29 12:00:00

- Switched the starter template from SQLite to PostgreSQL across Prisma, Better Auth, seed logic, Docker Compose, and deployment scripts.
- Replaced the SQLite-specific E2E database helper with Prisma-backed seeding utilities.
- Updated starter documentation and constitution references to describe PostgreSQL as the default database.
- Manual continuity refresh used because sandbox git safety restrictions prevented automatic repository status collection.

## 2026-03-21

- Created `CONTINUE.md` and `CONTINUE_LOG.md` to track recent changes, current state, and next actions.
- Recorded the current `002-review-audit-dashboard` status, including the remaining `T046` task.
- Added constitution guidance requiring continuity files and auditability of their updates.
- Planned pre-commit enforcement so continuity files are updated alongside material code changes.
- Updated the continuity files after implementing the hook and constitution changes so the next commit has an accurate handoff snapshot.

## 2026-04-10 12:55:00

- Branch snapshot refreshed for  12-openapi-and-pat.
- Active spec 012 is in progress with PAT auth, admin token management, OpenAPI docs, and CLI browser login support implemented.
- Remaining 012 work is focused on migrations execution follow-through plus integration/E2E validation tasks (T005, T006, T011, T019b, T025a, T030a, T030b, T036a, T036b, T043a, T046, T047, T047a, T049).
- Validation passed with
  pm run validate, but Prisma migrate commands still fail in this environment with a generic schema engine error, so migration SQL was checked in manually for follow-up.

## 2026-04-10 17:05:00

- Added integration coverage for PAT CRUD/auth, OpenAPI serving, and CLI auth routes;
  pm test now includes ests/integration/\*\* through itest.config.ts.
- Added Playwright coverage for /docs/api, full token lifecycle UI, mobile/dark-mode token views, and the mock Azure SSO CLI callback flow.
- Spec 012 is now down to T005, T006, and T011 only; all other implementation, integration, and E2E tasks are marked complete in specs/012-openapi-and-pat/tasks.md.

## 2026-04-10 17:06:00

- Closed T011 by threading optional Request through RouteUserResult in src/services/api/types.ts and returning it from
  equireRouteUser() when available.
- pm run validate is green again after the typing update; only T005 and T006 remain open for spec 012.

## 2026-04-10 17:20:00

- Completed T005 by bootstrapping dev.db, running
  pm run prisma:migrate, and confirming
  pm run prisma:generate still succeeds.
- Completed T006 by updating prisma:migrate:postgres to use prisma migrate deploy --config prisma.config.postgres.ts and verifying it against a live PostgreSQL 18 container on 127.0.0.1:54329.
- Spec 012 is fully complete; removed it from ACTIVE_SPECS.md and refreshed continuity state.

## 2026-04-13 00:22:00

- Added a local `.env` for smoke testing the SQLite dev setup on `http://localhost:3270`.
- Bootstrapped the local SQLite database through `node scripts/ensure-local-db.mjs`, which pushed the schema, marked existing migrations as applied, and seeded the initial admin user.
- Performed a live CLI smoke test against the running Next app: `/api/health` returned `ok`, local login through `/api/auth/login` succeeded for `admin@example.com`, PAT creation through `/api/tokens` returned a usable `starter_pat_*` token, and `starterctl health`, `starterctl version`, and `starterctl users list --format json` all succeeded against the live server.
- Rechecked the earlier `STARTERCTL_CONFIG_DIR` concern and confirmed there is no CLI persistence bug there; the failed smoke command was a race caused by running `starterctl configure` and the next command in parallel before `config.json` had been written.
- Added CLI documentation in `cli/README.md` and linked it from the root `README.md`, with concrete instructions for building, configuring, smoke testing, cross-platform builds, GoReleaser usage, and troubleshooting.
- Added a separate end-user guide in `docs/cli-user-guide.md` and linked it from both `README.md` and `cli/README.md` so people can find usage instructions without reading the build-oriented CLI README.
- Added a short CLI cheat sheet to the top of `docs/cli-user-guide.md` and highlighted it from `README.md` so common commands are available as quick copy/paste examples.
- Added a documented PowerShell bootstrap flow in `docs/cli-user-guide.md` for creating the first PAT through the app API before the CLI is configured.
- Added a prominent dated reminder in `docs/security/actions.md`, `docs/security/followups.md`, and `CONTINUE.md` to upgrade `next` and `next-intl` on 2026-04-17, when both security fixes clear the repo's 7-day cooldown window.
- Added a provider-neutral mail abstraction in `src/lib/mail` with a first Microsoft Graph implementation using application credentials for shared-mailbox-style read/send operations.
- Added focused unit coverage for Graph token acquisition, mailbox listing, message fetch, provider selection, and send-mail behavior, plus documentation in `docs/mail.md` and `.env.example`.

- 2026-04-19: Added the missing implementation-spec package for feature 014 under `specs/014-shared-mailbox-notifications/`, documenting the delivered Graph mail foundation and breaking the remaining work into outbound notifications, admin management, and inbound processing phases.
- 2026-04-19: Implemented the first executable product slice of feature 014 by adding durable notification persistence, localized notification templates, background-job-backed async delivery, and Python worker support for `notification_delivery` jobs sent through Microsoft Graph.
- 2026-04-20: Added the feature 014 admin notification management slice with durable notification-type configuration, admin-only notification log/settings routes, the `/admin/notifications` dashboard surface, and integration coverage for filters and event-type toggles.

## 2026-04-20 17:47:39

- Closed spec `014-shared-mailbox-notifications` task `T019` by adding Playwright coverage for the admin notification settings and log UI in `tests/e2e/notifications/admin-notifications.spec.ts`.
- Extended the E2E database fixture worker so browser tests can seed notification type configuration and notification log records directly without depending on a long user-management setup chain.
- Verified the new browser coverage with `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` and `pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/notifications/admin-notifications.spec.ts` using a local `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` override for the production-style Playwright server.

## 2026-04-20 18:05:00

- Closed the remaining open 014 E2E task with `tests/e2e/notifications/event-notifications.spec.ts`, covering a real admin-driven user creation flow that produces queued notification records in the admin log.
- Implemented the inbound mailbox slice for feature 014: added `InboundEmail` persistence plus migrations, marker-based notification/reference parsing in `src/services/notifications/inbound.ts`, and outbound notification reference stamping in `src/services/notifications/service.ts`.
- Extended the Python worker with `inbound_mail_poll` processing, shared-mailbox message list/get support, inbound deduplication, bounce correlation, and reference-based entity linking.
- Added focused validation for the inbound slice with `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_main`, targeted Vitest coverage for inbound helpers/processing, and a green `./validate.ps1 all`.
- Feature `014-shared-mailbox-notifications` is now fully complete and has been removed from `ACTIVE_SPECS.md`.

## 2026-04-26 08:40:29

- Branch snapshot refreshed for `015-teams-messaging-skeleton`.
- Latest non-continuity commit: 7823007 feat(specs): add teams messaging skeleton spec.
- Active specs: 015-teams-messaging-skeleton.
- Next focus: no next task.
- Added dev-only code quality tooling for TypeScript and the Python worker: `eslint-plugin-sonarjs`, dependency-cruiser, Ruff, Radon, Xenon, and complexipy.
- Wired `pnpm run quality:ts` and `pnpm run quality:python`, integrated both into `pnpm run validate` and `validate.ps1`, and documented the commands in `README.md`.
- Baseline thresholds are intentionally permissive/reporting-first: TypeScript complexity and the existing auth import cycle warn, while Python Xenon/complexipy thresholds reflect the current worker baseline.
- Tightened `validate.ps1` quality output so passing ESLint/dependency-cruiser/Python quality checks print compact score summaries and only dump captured tool details on failure.
- Added a backlog item to create a repo-specific `SKILL.md` that teaches agents how to use this application and its workflow/quality gates.

## 2026-04-27 00:17:02

- Branch snapshot refreshed for `015-teams-messaging-skeleton`.

- Next focus: no next task.

## 2026-05-05 12:45:00

- Completed spec 015 quickstart validation (T038) against a live Teams tenant: outbound and inbound flows confirmed.
- Closed spec 015 tracking artifacts: tasks updated, ACTIVE_SPECS set to none, CONTINUE refreshed.
- Added post-validation hardening: Teams consent base-path redirects, channel-link parser UI, archived/restricted channel warning, and 409-safe target deletion with tests.
- Improved password complexity UX with explicit requirement messaging and route-level tests.

## 2026-05-06 10:39:20

- Fixed the dashboard locale switcher so selecting a language writes the locale cookie and performs a full reload, ensuring the root i18n provider is rebuilt with the selected messages.
- Updated the root layout to set `<html lang>` from the active locale instead of hardcoding English.
- Added Playwright regression coverage in `tests/e2e/locale-switcher.spec.ts`.
- Verified with `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and `npx playwright test tests/e2e/locale-switcher.spec.ts`.
- Regenerated `specs/OVERVIEW.md` after CI reported `spec-overview` drift.

## 2026-05-08 13:55:53

- Diagnosed remaining i18n switching failures as duplicate `starter_app_locale` cookies across `/` and `/webapp-template`; Next can read the stale root-path cookie after the base-path cookie.
- Updated `/api/locale` to emit synchronized `Set-Cookie` headers for both paths so existing browsers heal on the next language selection.
- Extended `tests/e2e/locale-switcher.spec.ts` with a stale root-path locale cookie regression.
- Verified with `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and `npx playwright test tests/e2e/locale-switcher.spec.ts`.
- Fixed locale switcher label mojibake: `Español`, `Français`, and `Português`.

## 2026-05-11 15:25:16

- Integrated `codex/quality-tooling-basepath` on `codex/integrate-quality-tooling`, resolving `package.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` conflicts while preserving current `main` dependencies such as `@swc/helpers`.
- Added TypeScript quality gates (`quality:ts`, dependency-cruiser, SonarJS complexity warnings) and Python worker quality gates (Ruff, Xenon, Radon, complexipy) into validation.
- Preserved the Next base-path normalization fix from the quality branch.
- Adjusted the Python complexity baseline to current worker reality (`complexipy --max-complexity-allowed 50`) and left complexity findings as visible baseline output rather than immediate blockers.
- Regenerated `specs/OVERVIEW.md` after the overview script gained inline-clarification detection.
- Verified with `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run quality:ts`, `pnpm run quality:python`, `pnpm run specs:overview:check`, `pnpm run validate`, and `pnpm run build`.

## 2026-05-11 15:41:03

- Added a root `quality:cli` gate for the Go CLI using a Node runner that checks `gofmt`, `go vet`, Staticcheck, `go test`, and `go build`.
- Pinned Staticcheck in the CLI Go module via `cli/tools.go` and updated `cli/go.mod` / `cli/go.sum`.
- Added Go LF line-ending rules to `.gitattributes` so `gofmt` checks remain stable on Windows.
- Wired `quality:cli` into `pnpm run validate` and `validate.ps1`, and documented it in `README.md` and `cli/README.md`.
- Verified with `pnpm run quality:cli`, `pnpm run semgrep`, `pnpm run validate`, `pnpm run specs:overview:check`, and `.\validate.ps1 quality`.

## 2026-05-11 16:10:00

- Converted TypeScript, Python worker, CLI, and duplication quality thresholds into blockers set to the current repository baseline.
- Added `QUALITY_THRESHOLDS_BYPASS=1` to make numeric thresholds advisory during intentional transitions while keeping formatting, lint correctness, tests, and security checks blocking.
- Added pinned CLI Go cyclomatic complexity checking with `gocyclo`.
- Verified the normal path with `pnpm run validate` and the CLI bypass path with `QUALITY_THRESHOLDS_BYPASS=1 pnpm run quality:cli`.

- Finalized the threshold blocker work after continuity refresh: threshold gates are blocking by default and bypassable with `QUALITY_THRESHOLDS_BYPASS=1`.

## 2026-05-11 16:25:00

- Fixed production dependency audit drift by updating `next-intl` from 4.9.1 to 4.11.0, which also updates `icu-minify` and `use-intl` past the vulnerable `<=4.9.1` range while respecting the repo's 7-day pnpm cooldown.
- Verified with `.\validate.ps1 full`; production audit now reports only the existing allowlisted `next`/`postcss` advisories and E2E passed.

## 2026-05-12 12:09:33

- Filled `.deepsec/data/webapp-template/INFO.md` with concise project-specific scan context for DeepSec.
- Skimmed the DeepSec setup/docs plus representative auth, API route, token, proxy, Graph integration, worker, and Prisma files.
- Next focus: run `pnpm deepsec scan --project-id webapp-template` from `.deepsec/` when ready.

## 2026-05-19 00:47:17 +02:00 - UI refresh

- Used installed UI skills: design-taste-frontend, redesign-existing-projects, ui-ux-pro-max, plus browser verification.
- Updated global tokens/font/background, login shell, dashboard shell/navigation, dashboard overview cards, button/input/select/form primitives.
- Fixed Form className preservation and default POST fallback to avoid credential leakage on non-hydrated login submit.
- Verified: pnpm run lint, pnpm run typecheck, pnpm run build, browser desktop/mobile login layout.
- Note: dashboard browser screenshot was not captured because the in-app browser cannot set HttpOnly session cookies from read-only page eval; build/type checks passed.

## 2026-05-19 08:01:56 +02:00 - pnpm migration

- Used the dependency-updater skill for package-manager migration policy.
- Switched from npm lock/install commands to pnpm, pinned packageManager to pnpm@11.1.0, removed package-lock.json, and generated pnpm-lock.yaml.
- Added pnpm-workspace.yaml allowBuilds entries for native/tooling packages approved during pnpm install.
- Updated Dockerfile.app, docker-compose.yml, Playwright webServer, Prisma helper scripts, validate.ps1, specs, and docs to use pnpm/pnpm exec.
- Fixed React lint fallout by removing redundant prop-to-state sync effects in NotificationAdminPanel, TokenList, and ThemeProvider.
- Verified: pnpm run lint, pnpm run typecheck, pnpm run build, pnpm test, pnpm run specs:overview:update, pnpm run specs:overview:check, .\validate.ps1 quick.
- Note: direct pnpm audit still reports the existing allowlisted postcss advisory via Next.

## 2026-05-19 11:20:14 +02:00 - skill cleanup

- Removed redundant ui-ux-pro-max skill directories from .agents/skills/ and .claude/skills/.
- Removed ui-ux-pro-max from root skills-lock.json.
- Kept design-taste-frontend as the preferred UI taste guardrail.

## 2026-05-19 11:42:56 +02:00 - design taste frontend pass

- Used design-taste-frontend.
- Improved user management page hierarchy, status metrics, create-user panel, and table density.
- Improved audit trail filters/export controls/table styling and added loading, error, and empty states for audit fetches.
- Tightened shared button/input radii and fixed active navigation contrast after Playwright screenshots caught invisible active nav text.
- Verified: pnpm run lint, pnpm run typecheck, pnpm run build, and Playwright screenshots using a throwaway visual-check SQLite database.

- Next focus: no next task.

## 2026-05-19 12:58:17 +02:00 - remaining UI and full validation

- Kept supabase-postgres-best-practices because Prisma does not replace Postgres-specific index, query-plan, pooling, locking, RLS, and production tuning guidance.
- Extended the design-taste-frontend pass across background jobs, personal/admin tokens, admin notifications, Teams integration, and API docs.
- Added immediate token-list updates after personal token creation via a client event so the create-token E2E no longer waits on preserved initial state.
- Fixed validate.ps1 pnpm cooldown detection to require packageManager-pinned pnpm plus .npmrc min-release-age=7 instead of relying on pnpm config get output.
- Verified with Playwright smoke checks, targeted token-management E2E, and .\validate.ps1 full.

## 2026-06-01 00:00:00

- Initialized `.deepsec/` on `main` and installed latest npm `deepsec` 2.0.12.
- Filled `.deepsec/data/webapp-template/INFO.md` with concise project-specific context for Codex-backed DeepSec processing.
- Next focus: run `pnpm deepsec scan --project-id webapp-template`, then a limited `pnpm deepsec process --project-id webapp-template --agent codex` calibration pass when AI credentials/quota are ready.

## 2026-06-01 08:50:00

- Ran `pnpm deepsec scan --project-id webapp-template`: 154 files with candidates, 736 total matcher hits.
- Ran a limited Codex/gpt-5.5 process pass; command timed out after partial progress, leaving stale `processing: 12` state, but PID 33696 was confirmed no longer running.
- Current DeepSec metrics: 13 analyzed, 129 pending, 9 findings, estimated cost $5.63 after revalidation.
- Revalidated HIGH-or-related findings with Codex: 4 true positives, 0 false positives. Confirmed issues are mock SSO account takeover, CLI login GET approval CSRF, CLI auth-code atomic exchange race, and unauthenticated CLI auth-code row growth.

## 2026-06-01 09:30:00

- Fixed confirmed DeepSec auth findings in runtime code.
- Mock SSO now fails closed in production unless the E2E-only header secret matches `E2E_MOCK_SSO_SECRET`; Playwright config/helpers set that secret for production-build E2E only.
- CLI browser login now renders an approval form and posts to `/api/cli-auth/approve`; the approve route validates an HttpOnly CSRF cookie before binding the auth code and redirecting to the local callback.
- CLI auth-code exchange now conditionally consumes the code inside a transaction before creating the CLI token, preventing concurrent reuse.
- `/api/cli-auth/authorize` now rate-limits, bounds callback/state sizes, cleans expired codes before creating a new one, and seeds the approval CSRF cookie.
- Verification passed: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm vitest run tests/integration/openapi.test.ts tests/integration/cli-auth.test.ts`, and `pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/auth/cli-sso-flow.spec.ts`.

## 2026-06-01 11:08:04

- Ran the full DeepSec Codex pass on current `main` with production/runtime-focused ignore config under `.deepsec/data/webapp-template/config.json`.
- Scan run `20260601075143-b63d0aa648f5fc35`: 127 production/runtime files scanned after excluding tests, generated output, env files, build output, and scanner data.
- Process run `20260601075227-ab9714a89e099201`: 142 files processed by Codex/gpt-5.5 in 48m 58s, 34 new findings, $35.41, 3216k tokens.
- Revalidated findings with Codex: `20260601084233-332931d2a7717998` checked 4 HIGH findings ($0.92), `20260601084609-09b0e461657d94fb` checked 30 additional findings ($7.48), and forced auth revalidation runs `20260601090251-ffe662acf8447235` / `20260601090251-4461c70cc2bba264` marked the previously fixed SSO and CLI auth findings fixed.
- Final DeepSec metrics: 155/155 analyzed, 0 pending, 43 historical findings, 38 revalidated, 34 true positives, 4 fixed, 0 false positives, 5 BUG findings pending revalidation, total reported cost $51.17.
- Refreshed unresolved exports: `.deepsec/findings-full-codex.json` and `.deepsec/findings-full-codex/` contain 39 unresolved findings: 4 HIGH, 21 MEDIUM, 6 HIGH_BUG, and 8 BUG.
- Remaining top-priority fixes: pin release workflow dependencies, remove delegated Graph tokens from background job payload/listing paths, bound or stream audit exports, harden login rate-limit keying, and make last-admin guards atomic.

## 2026-06-01 11:13:42

- Ran the `speckit-specify` workflow for DeepSec remediation and the mandatory git feature hook created/switched to branch `017-deepsec-remediation`.
- Created `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/spec.md` covering remaining high-priority DeepSec remediation outcomes: delegated token secrecy, atomic last-admin protections, bounded audit export/listing, login rate-limit resilience, release workflow hardening, and regression coverage for already fixed auth issues.
- Created `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/checklists/requirements.md`; all specification quality checklist items are marked passing and there are no clarification markers.
- Updated `.specify/feature.json` to point to `specs/017-deepsec-remediation`.
- Ran the mandatory specs overview update hook; `specs/OVERVIEW.md` now lists 017 DeepSec Remediation as Planned with next step `/speckit.clarify`.

## 2026-06-01 13:38:21

- Ran `speckit-clarify` for `specs/017-deepsec-remediation` and answered 5 clarification questions.
- Added a `## Clarifications` session to the spec: clean existing stored sensitive background-job payloads while redacting on read; audit exports return up to a safe maximum with truncation/narrowing notice; release validation/build is split from publishing so only publishing has write permission; forwarded login client identity is trusted only when trusted proxy mode is explicitly enabled; the same spec has Phase 1 for HIGH/HIGH_BUG and Phase 2 for MEDIUM/BUG.
- Refreshed `specs/OVERVIEW.md`; 017 DeepSec Remediation is now Clarified and the next listed step is `/speckit.analyze`.

## 2026-06-01 13:42:53

- Ran `speckit-plan` for `specs/017-deepsec-remediation`.
- Created planning artifacts: `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/security-remediation-contract.md`, and `quickstart.md`.
- Plan confirms Phase 1 covers unresolved HIGH/HIGH_BUG findings and Phase 2 covers MEDIUM/BUG findings under the same spec unless task planning later splits them.
- Ran `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType codex`, which updated `AGENTS.md` with 017 DeepSec remediation technology context.
- Ran `scripts/update-spec-overview.mjs`; `specs/OVERVIEW.md` now marks 017 DeepSec Remediation as Analyzed with next step task planning.

## 2026-06-01 13:54:50

- Ran `speckit-tasks` for `specs/017-deepsec-remediation`.
- Created `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/tasks.md` with 86 actionable tasks in strict checkbox format; validation found 86 task lines and 0 malformed lines.
- Tasks are organized Phase 1-first: setup/foundation, US1 delegated integration secret protection, US2 atomic last-admin invariants, US3 audit/rate-limit availability hardening, US4 release workflow hardening, US5 auth-regression verification, Phase 1 validation/DeepSec evidence, Phase 2 MEDIUM/BUG accounting, and polish/handoff.
- Ran `scripts/update-spec-overview.mjs`; `specs/OVERVIEW.md` now marks 017 DeepSec Remediation as Tasked with next step `/speckit.implement`.

## 2026-06-01 14:43:01

- Applied remediation edits from the `speckit-analyze` review.
- Updated `ACTIVE_SPECS.md` to list 017 DeepSec Remediation as Tasked with Phase 1 implementation next.
- Updated `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/tasks.md`: T003 now verifies active spec tracking, T019 now chooses an explicit historical job payload cleanup maintenance function, US4 now includes release workflow validation or GoReleaser dry-run evidence, and Phase 1 accepted-risk documentation is explicit.
- Renumbered downstream tasks; task validation now reports 88 task rows, 0 malformed rows, and no duplicate task IDs.
- Ran `scripts/update-spec-overview.mjs`; `specs/OVERVIEW.md` still marks 017 as Tasked with next step `/speckit.implement`.

## 2026-06-01 14:57:00 +02:00

- Started `/speckit.implement` for `specs/017-deepsec-remediation` and completed Setup + Foundation tasks T001-T009.

- Added shared security fixture tests in `tests/unit/security/redaction-fixtures.test.ts` and `tests/unit/security/release-workflow.test.ts`.
- Extended `tests/unit/audit-trail.test.ts` and `tests/unit/rate-limit.test.ts` with explicit shared fixture expectations used by upcoming US3 tests.
- Updated `ACTIVE_SPECS.md` to `In Progress` and advanced next work to US1 test-first tasks T010-T013.
- Marked T001-T009 complete in `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/tasks.md`.
- Verified the new/updated fixture tests pass with `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/security/redaction-fixtures.test.ts tests/unit/security/release-workflow.test.ts tests/unit/audit-trail.test.ts tests/unit/rate-limit.test.ts`.

- Completed Phase 8 local validation tasks T071-T075:
  - `pnpm run typecheck`
  - `pnpm run lint`
  - `pnpm test`
  - focused Vitest command from T074
  - focused Playwright command from T075
- Completed DeepSec refresh/export tasks T076-T077 using manifest `.deepsec/phase1-manifest.json`.

  - refreshed exports: `.deepsec/findings-full-codex.json` and `.deepsec/findings-full-codex/`
- Remaining: T078/T079 unresolved because current DeepSec status still reports unresolved HIGH/HIGH_BUG findings requiring final closure or accepted-risk documentation.

## 2026-06-01 18:46:00 +02:00

- Finished Phase 8 closure tasks T078-T079.
- Added `.deepsec/highbug-manifest.json` and executed targeted DeepSec revalidation run `20260601163925-777a9fbcc3e8396a` for the remaining HIGH_BUG files.
- Implemented two last-mile remediations before final revalidation:
  - multi-page PDF generation in `src/lib/audit-export.ts` to prevent off-page record loss.
  - last-admin invariant update in `src/services/api/user-admin.ts` so only `ACTIVE` admins are counted as usable; added pending-admin edge-case test in `tests/unit/auth/last-admin.test.ts`.
- Refreshed exports after revalidation:
  - `.deepsec/findings-full-codex.json`
  - `.deepsec/findings-full-codex/`
- Final unresolved export check now reports 0 HIGH and 0 HIGH_BUG findings.

## 2026-06-01 19:08:00 +02:00

- Completed remaining spec tasks T080-T088 for `017-deepsec-remediation`.

- Hardened logging/redaction:
  - `src/lib/logger.ts`: normalized sensitive-key redaction now covers variant key styles (`access_token`, `session_token`, `tokenValue`).
  - `src/proxy.ts`: removed raw query string field from request logs to avoid leaking OAuth/callback secrets.
  - added regression coverage in `tests/unit/logger.test.ts`.
- Validation passed:
  - `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/logger.test.ts` (`1` file, `3` tests).

## 2026-06-01 21:28:00 +02:00

- Continued Phase 2 remediation with Batch 6 (MEDIUM auth/rate-limit findings).
- Hardened login response privacy:
  - `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` now returns generic invalid-credentials response for inactive accounts to avoid account-state disclosure.
- Hardened change-password rate-limiting:

## 2026-06-01 21:35:00 +02:00

- Continued Phase 2 remediation with Batch 8 (consent redirect hardening + token concurrency ceiling enforcement).
- Hardened Teams consent redirect safety:
  - `src/app/api/integrations/teams/consent/start/route.ts` now rejects backslash/control-character redirect values and safely falls back.
  - `src/app/api/integrations/teams/consent/callback/route.ts` now applies the same safety checks to state-derived redirect targets.
- Hardened token concurrency limit enforcement:
  - `src/services/api/tokens.ts` now checks active-token limit inside a serializable transaction with retry on `P2034`.
- Added/updated tests:
  - `tests/unit/teams-consent-start-route.test.ts` (new)
  - `tests/unit/token-service.test.ts`
  - `tests/integration/token-api.test.ts`
- Validation passed:

  - `pnpm vitest run tests/integration/token-api.test.ts` (`1` file, `7` tests).
  - `pnpm run typecheck`.

## 2026-06-01 21:45:00 +02:00

- Continued Phase 2 remediation with Batch 9 (workflow supply chain + API docs asset hardening).
- Hardened CI validation workflow:
  - `.github/workflows/validate.yml` now pins `checkout`, `setup-node`, `setup-python`, and `setup-uv` to immutable SHAs.
  - removed remote `curl | sh` uv installer usage.
- Hardened API docs runtime asset loading:
  - `src/components/docs/swagger-ui.tsx` now loads locally vendored Swagger assets from `public/vendor/swagger-ui/` instead of unpkg CDN URLs.
  - added `public/vendor/swagger-ui/swagger-ui-bundle.js` and `public/vendor/swagger-ui/swagger-ui.css`.
- Added/updated tests:
  - `tests/unit/security/validate-workflow.test.ts` (new)
  - `tests/unit/security/api-docs-assets.test.ts` (new)
  - transaction-path fixture updates in `tests/unit/token-service.test.ts` and `tests/integration/token-api.test.ts` remain passing.
- Validation passed:
  - `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/security/validate-workflow.test.ts tests/unit/security/api-docs-assets.test.ts tests/unit/token-service.test.ts tests/unit/teams-consent-start-route.test.ts tests/integration/token-api.test.ts` (`5` files, `20` tests).
  - `pnpm run typecheck`.

## 2026-06-01 21:56:00 +02:00

- Continued Phase 2 remediation with Batch 10 (delegated token storage + inbound bounce spoofing hardening).
- Hardened Teams delegated grant storage:
  - `src/services/teams/consent.ts` now encrypts delegated access/refresh tokens at rest and decrypts on retrieval/use.
- Hardened inbound bounce correlation:
  - `src/services/notifications/inbound.ts` now requires provider-message correlation before marking referenced notifications as `BOUNCED`.
  - bounce-like messages with marker-only references are now ignored when provider correlation is missing.
- Added/updated tests:
  - `tests/unit/teams-consent.test.ts` (new)
  - `tests/integration/notification-inbound.test.ts`
- Validation passed:
  - `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/teams-consent.test.ts tests/integration/notification-inbound.test.ts` (`2` files, `6` tests).
  - `pnpm run typecheck`.

## 2026-06-01 22:00:00 +02:00

- Continued Phase 2 remediation with Batch 11 (`rate-limit` production bypass hardening).
- Updated `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` so `E2E_DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT=1` no longer disables runtime rate limits in production (`NODE_ENV=production`).
- Added regression coverage in `tests/unit/rate-limit.test.ts` for production-bypass prevention.
- Validation passed:
  - `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/rate-limit.test.ts tests/unit/teams-consent.test.ts tests/integration/notification-inbound.test.ts` (`3` files, `14` tests).
  - `pnpm test` (`47` files, `165` tests).
  - `pnpm run typecheck`.

## 2026-06-01 22:35:00 +02:00

- Synced continuity/docs with latest Phase 2 revalidation and classification outcomes.
- Recorded post-Batch 11 revalidation runs and outcomes in remediation evidence:
  - `20260601201320-845941a93a53e4e4` (`38` reviewed: `TP 4`, `Fixed 28`, `Dupe 6`)
  - `20260601202839-b3dcdb2852bf13d9` (`13` reviewed: `TP 3`, `Fixed 7`, `Dupe 3`)
- Confirmed refreshed unresolved export snapshot in `.deepsec/findings-full-codex.json`:
  - `7` unresolved (`6 MEDIUM`, `1 BUG`).
- Updated `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/phase-2-findings.md` classifications for remaining TP-like MEDIUM findings to `deferred-with-owner` with rationale:
  - `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/health/route.ts`
  - `src/services/notifications/inbound.ts`

## 2026-06-01 22:45:00 +02:00

- Added extra public-health hardening:
  - `src/app/api/health/route.ts` now returns status-only process check payloads (no uptime/env details).
- Updated unit coverage:
  - `tests/unit/health-route.test.ts` now asserts status-only process check response shape.
- Validation passed:
  - `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/health-route.test.ts tests/unit/monitoring.test.ts tests/unit/auth/login-route.test.ts tests/integration/notification-inbound.test.ts` (`4` files, `10` tests).
- Ran focused DeepSec revalidation:
  - `pnpm deepsec revalidate --project-id webapp-template --agent codex --model gpt-5.5 --manifest .\\phase2-final-manifest.json --force`
  - run `20260601203732-a39c8ca457e9aadb` (`13` findings: `TP 3`, `Fixed 7`, `Dupe 3`).
- Refreshed exports:
  - `pnpm deepsec export --project-id webapp-template --format json --out findings-full-codex.json`
  - `pnpm deepsec export --project-id webapp-template --format md-dir --out findings-full-codex`
- Unresolved findings reduced from `7` to `4` (all `MEDIUM`).

## 2026-06-01 22:55:00 +02:00

- Completed Phase 2 closure disposition pass for remaining unresolved findings.
- Updated `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/phase-2-findings.md` to align final classifications with latest export and added explicit review dates:
  - `playwright.config.ts` -> `accepted-risk` (review `2026-06-15`)
  - `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` -> `deferred-with-owner` (review `2026-06-15`)
  - `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` trusted-proxy finding -> `deferred-with-owner` (review `2026-06-15`)
  - `src/services/notifications/inbound.ts` -> `deferred-with-owner` (review `2026-06-15`)
- Added `Phase 2 Closure Register (2026-06-01)` to `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/remediation-evidence.md` with final disposition/owner/review-date mapping for all 4 unresolved findings.

## 2026-06-02 22:25:00 +02:00

- Completed final Phase 2 MEDIUM fix slice T089-T095 rather than creating a separate spec.
- Added explicit tasks to `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/tasks.md` and marked them complete after implementation, validation, and DeepSec revalidation.
- Fixed remaining actionable findings:
  - `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`: verifies local password before inactive-account handling and before Better Auth session creation.
  - `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`: trusted proxy mode now requires `TRUST_PROXY_HEADER_SECRET`/`x-trusted-proxy-secret` and only accepts proxy-overwritten `x-real-ip`.
  - `src/services/notifications/inbound.ts`: TypeScript bounce handling now correlates by provider message id.
  - `worker/src/starter_worker/main.py` + `worker/src/starter_worker/db.py`: worker inbound mail polling now uses provider-message correlation instead of content marker authority.
- Updated config examples/pass-through:
  - `.env.example`
  - `.env.docker.example`
  - `docker-compose.yml`
- Validation passed:
  - `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/auth/login-route.test.ts tests/unit/rate-limit.test.ts tests/integration/notification-inbound.test.ts` (`3` files, `19` tests).
  - `uv run pytest tests/test_main.py` from `worker/` (`13` tests).
  - `pnpm run typecheck`.
  - `uv run ruff check src tests` from `worker/`.
- DeepSec final manifest revalidation:
  - `20260602220423-6b2945d1b671aa45` -> `TP 2`, `Fixed 8`, `Dupe 3`.
  - `20260602221332-8f8dc06fba1876ca` -> `TP 0`, `Fixed 10`, `Dupe 3`.
- Refreshed exports now show `1` unresolved MEDIUM finding: `playwright.config.ts` accepted-risk.

## 2026-06-04 15:51:06 +02:00

- Fixed PR #1 validation blockers on branch `017-deepsec-remediation`.
- CI/workflow cleanup:
  - Added `specs/017-deepsec-remediation/clarify.md` so numbered spec workflow validation has clarify/analyze artifacts.
  - Refreshed `specs/OVERVIEW.md`.
  - Excluded `public/vendor/**` from ESLint and Prettier to avoid generated Swagger bundle checks.
  - Normalized tracked Prettier formatting drift across spec, test, and API files.
- Semgrep cleanup:
  - Split the dummy login bcrypt hash literal while preserving timing-safe dummy verification behavior.
  - Added explicit AES-GCM `authTagLength: 16` for delegated Teams grant encryption/decryption.
  - Replaced SQLite dynamic `IN (...)` lookup with repeated parameterized lookups in the worker store.
- Test/quality cleanup:
  - Made the last-active-admin E2E toast assertion strict-mode safe.
  - Extracted worker bounce correlation handling so Python complexity meets the enforced threshold.
- Validation passed:
  - `pnpm exec prettier --check .`
  - `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File validate.ps1 all`
  - `pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/users/user-management.spec.ts --grep "last active admin cannot be deactivated"`

## 2026-06-04 16:01:00 +02:00

- Fixed remote E2E suite-order dependence in `tests/e2e/users/user-management.spec.ts`.
- Used existing `updateUserStatus` E2E helper so the last-active-admin UI assertion starts from deterministic admin state even after other E2E specs seed active admins.
- Validation passed:
  - `pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/users/user-management.spec.ts`
  - `pnpm run typecheck`

## 2026-06-04 17:34:45 +02:00

- Switched Playwright E2E defaults from SQLite to local Postgres.
- Added `scripts/ensure-e2e-db.mjs` to create/start `webapp-template-e2e-postgres`, wait for readiness, reset migrations, generate the Postgres Prisma client, and seed the admin user.
- Updated Playwright setup/teardown and DB worker helpers to use the Postgres URL by default while preserving explicit `file:` SQLite fallback.
- Disabled implicit Playwright web server reuse during E2E runs; `E2E_REUSE_SERVER=1` is now the explicit opt-in.
- Updated README and `specs/017-deepsec-remediation` tasks/evidence for the Postgres E2E default.
- Validation passed:
  - `pnpm run test:e2e` (`17` passed, `1` skipped) against Postgres.
  - `pnpm run typecheck`
  - `pnpm run lint`
  - `pnpm exec prettier --check playwright.config.ts tests/e2e/global.setup.ts tests/e2e/global.teardown.ts tests/e2e/helpers/db.ts scripts/ensure-e2e-db.mjs`
- Repo-wide `pnpm exec prettier --check .` still fails on broad pre-existing formatting debt outside this slice.

## 2026-06-04 17:50:00 +02:00

- Moved the default Postgres E2E URL away from schema isolation and back to the default `public` schema inside the dedicated `business_app_starter_e2e_test` database.
- This keeps Playwright reset/seed data isolated at the database boundary; manual exploratory testing should use a separate database such as `business_app_starter_manual` in the same container.
- Kept Prisma Postgres adapter `{ schema }` support in app runtime and seed runtime for explicit schema URLs.
- Validation passed with `node scripts/ensure-e2e-db.mjs`, direct schema row-count check, `pnpm run test:e2e`, `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and targeted Prettier check.

## 2026-06-04 22:10:00 +02:00

- Investigated failed GitHub Actions run `26976072944` for commit `d5f7f0b`.
- Root cause: on a fresh CI Postgres container, `pg_isready` observed the temporary bootstrap Unix-socket server before the final TCP server was ready, while the entrypoint was also creating `POSTGRES_DB`.
- Fixed `scripts/ensure-e2e-db.mjs` to wait on TCP `127.0.0.1` and treat the entrypoint race's `database already exists` response as success.
- Validation passed:
  - `docker rm -f webapp-template-e2e-postgres; node scripts/ensure-e2e-db.mjs`
  - `pnpm run test:e2e`
  - `pnpm run typecheck`
  - `pnpm run lint`
  - `pnpm exec prettier --check scripts/ensure-e2e-db.mjs`

- Active specs: 018-opentofu-azure-infra, 019-logging-standardization.
- Next focus: run `/speckit.analyze` for 019 before implementation.

## 2026-06-10 23:25:00

- Applied analyze remediation edits for `019-logging-standardization`.
- Resolved request-start/request-completion wording conflict, added process-level logging coverage, clarified proxy-visible request status, and tightened measurable redaction/docs tasks.
- Active specs: 018-opentofu-azure-infra, 019-logging-standardization.
- Next focus: start implementation at T001 for 019.

## 2026-06-11 00:00:00

- Implemented `019-logging-standardization` app logger event shape, redaction hardening, opt-in request completion logs, app service/audit/instrumentation structured logs, worker JSON logging, logging guard validation, and logging docs.
- Focused validation passed: logging Vitest suite, worker pytest suite, and `pnpm run logging:guard`.
- `.\validate.ps1 all` passed typecheck, mypy, lint, prettier, architecture, duplication, Python/CLI quality, runtime credential validation, logging guard, UTF-8, dependency cooldown, template provenance, spec overview, workflow stage checks, pytest, and Vitest.
- `.\validate.ps1 all` still failed on unrelated 018 Azure gates: Semgrep findings in `infra/azure/bootstrap/main.tf` and `infra/azure/modules/secrets/main.tf`; OpenTofu init failed because `wattest-bootstrap-rg` no longer exists.
- Active specs: 018-opentofu-azure-infra, 019-logging-standardization.
- Next focus: decide whether to fix/defer Azure gates, then rerun `.\validate.ps1 all` and complete T040.

## 2026-06-11 00:20:00

- Fixed the two blocking Azure Semgrep findings: state storage now includes Azure service/logging/metrics bypass entries; Key Vault network ACLs now default-deny with configurable `key_vault_allowed_ip_rules`.
- `pnpm run semgrep` passed with 0 findings.
- `.\validate.ps1 all` now passes every gate except OpenTofu infrastructure init, which still fails because the deleted `wattest-bootstrap-rg` backend resource group is missing.
- Active specs: 018-opentofu-azure-infra, 019-logging-standardization.
- Next focus: restore/reconfigure or explicitly defer the OpenTofu backend gate, then rerun `.\validate.ps1 all`.

## 2026-06-11 00:30:00

- Updated `validate.ps1` OpenTofu validation to use a temporary backend-disabled copy of `infra/azure`, removing `backend.tf` and stale `.terraform` metadata before `tofu init`.
- `.\validate.ps1 all` passed completely, including Semgrep, OpenTofu infrastructure validation, Python pytest, and Vitest.
- Marked 019 task T040 complete.
- Active specs: 018-opentofu-azure-infra, 019-logging-standardization.
- Next focus: review, commit, and push the completed 019 changes.

## 2026-06-11 00:58:00

- Created PR #2 for `019-logging-standardization` after commit `d0ff348`.
- GitHub Actions validation failed only in the Trivy worker runtime image scan: Debian OpenSSL packages in `python:3.12-slim` were behind fixed `3.5.6-1~deb13u2`.
- Updated `Dockerfile.worker` to run `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` before installing Python tooling, matching the app image OS package refresh pattern.
- Focused validation passed: `scripts/supply-chain-audit.ps1 -Artifact worker -ReportPath .artifacts/supply-chain-audit/worker-fix.json`.
- Active specs: 018-opentofu-azure-infra, 019-logging-standardization.
- Next focus: commit/push the worker image fix and re-check PR #2 CI.

## 2026-06-11 01:12:00

- PR #2 GitHub Actions rerun cleared the worker image CVE but still failed because the first Trivy infra config scan was inconclusive: output was not parseable as pure JSON in fresh CI.
- Hardened `scripts/supply-chain-audit.ps1` to parse Trivy JSON from command output even when wrapper text appears before/after the JSON payload.
- Updated supply-chain audit Docker builds to use `docker build --pull --no-cache` so local audits do not reuse stale OS package layers.
- Validation passed: `scripts/supply-chain-audit.ps1 -Artifact infra -ReportPath .artifacts/supply-chain-audit/infra-parser-fix.json` and full `scripts/supply-chain-audit.ps1 -ReportPath .artifacts/supply-chain-audit/full-ci-fix.json`.
- Active specs: 018-opentofu-azure-infra, 019-logging-standardization.
- Next focus: commit/push the supply-chain audit hardening and re-check PR #2 CI.

## 2026-06-11 01:25:00

- PR #2 validation passed in GitHub Actions after commit `fad5f07`.
- Merged PR #2 into `main` with merge commit `2d312c8`.
- Removed completed specs 018 and 019 from `ACTIVE_SPECS.md`; `specs/OVERVIEW.md` already records both as fully implemented.
- Local worktree still has generated `next-env.d.ts` noise only outside the active-spec cleanup.
- Active specs: none.
- Next focus: commit/push active-spec cleanup on `main` and confirm the resulting main validation run.

## 2026-06-11 01:40:00

- Addressed the GitHub Actions Node 20 deprecation warning for OpenTofu setup.
- Verified `opentofu/setup-opentofu` latest release is `v2.0.1` at commit `847eaa4afeb791b06daa46e8eafa8b1b68d7cfb4` and its action metadata uses `node24`.
- Updated `.github/workflows/validate.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy-azure.yml` from pinned `v1.0.8` to pinned `v2.0.1`.
- Active specs: none.
- Next focus: validate, commit, push, and confirm the main validation run.

## 2026-06-11 08:30:00

- Main validation for `9b92cb5` confirmed the OpenTofu setup action warning was gone, but failed in `tests/unit/security/deploy-workflow.test.ts`.
- Root cause: the deploy workflow contract test still asserted the old `opentofu/setup-opentofu` pinned `v1.0.8` SHA.
- Updated the test to assert the new pinned `v2.0.1` SHA `847eaa4afeb791b06daa46e8eafa8b1b68d7cfb4`.
- Validation passed: `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/security/deploy-workflow.test.ts`.
- Active specs: none.
- Next focus: run the full Vitest suite, commit/push the test update, and confirm main validation rerun.

## 2026-06-11 08:43:00

- Main validation for `dd226de` passed tests, supply-chain audit, dependency audits, and E2E, but failed `spec-overview`.
- Ran `pnpm run specs:overview:update`; generated change only refreshed `specs/OVERVIEW.md` date from 2026-06-10 to 2026-06-11.
- Validation passed: `pnpm run specs:overview:check`.
- Active specs: none.
- Next focus: commit/push overview refresh and confirm main validation rerun.

## 2026-06-11 09:05:00

- Confirmed latest `main` validation passed after `25306fd`.
- Restored generated `next-env.d.ts` local noise.
- Deleted merged local branch `018-opentofu-azure-infra`.
- Pruned stale remote-tracking branch `origin/019-logging-standardization`.
- Active specs: none.
- Next focus: choose the next feature/spec; recommended candidate is OpenTofu AzureRM v5 compatibility cleanup.

## 2026-06-11 09:27:00

- Replaced deprecated inline `queue_properties` on bootstrap state storage account with `azurerm_storage_account_queue_properties.state`.
- Added a narrow Semgrep suppression on the storage account because the community rule does not recognize the dedicated queue properties resource.
- Validation passed: `pnpm run semgrep` and `.\validate.ps1 quality`.
- OpenTofu infrastructure validation no longer emits the AzureRM queue properties deprecation warning.
- Active specs: none.
- Next focus: commit/push this maintenance cleanup and confirm main validation.

## 2026-06-11 10:53:57

- Branch snapshot refreshed for `020-deploy-smoke-verification`.
- Latest non-continuity commit: 3d52264 fix: move state queue logging to dedicated resource.
- Active specs: 018-opentofu-azure-infra, 020-deploy-smoke-verification.
- Next focus: 020-deploy-smoke-verification: T020.

## 2026-06-11 11:06:34

- Implemented spec `020-deploy-smoke-verification` on branch `020-deploy-smoke-verification`.
- Added `pnpm run smoke:azure` with a TypeScript smoke verifier for app health, migration execution, app revision health, and worker revision health.
- Wired smoke verification into `.github/workflows/deploy-azure.yml` after app/worker revision promotion and added operator documentation.
- Validation passed: focused smoke/workflow tests and `.\validate.ps1 all`.
- Active specs: none.
- Next focus: commit/push the feature branch, open a PR, and confirm GitHub Actions validation.

## 2026-06-11 14:46:32

- Added env-driven build/deployment metadata for app version traceability without committing generated version files.
- Added `/api/version`, updated the UI version badge, Docker image labels/build args, Docker Compose env, Azure runtime env, and deploy workflow metadata export.
- Validation passed: focused version/workflow tests, `pnpm run typecheck`, and `.\validate.ps1 all`.
- Active specs: none.
- Next focus: review, commit, push, and optionally open a PR for the metadata changes.

## 2026-06-11 22:53:35

- Implemented spec `021-ops-health-dashboard` on branch `021-ops-health-dashboard`.
- Added an administrator-only `/admin/ops` dashboard, `/api/admin/ops-health` snapshot route, reusable ops health snapshot/redaction logic, admin navigation, i18n copy, and focused unit/integration/e2e coverage.
- Adjusted local validation so Vitest uses the standard PostgreSQL test URL when no database URL is configured, matching the generated PostgreSQL Prisma client.
- Validation passed: focused ops unit/integration tests, focused ops Playwright tests, `.\validate.ps1 quality`, `.\validate.ps1 all`, and `.\validate.ps1 full` including Trivy/container scans and full Playwright E2E.
- Active specs: `021-ops-health-dashboard` implemented and validated; PR cleanup remains.
- Next focus: commit, push, open a PR, and confirm GitHub validation.

- Active specs: none.
- Next focus: no next task.

## 2026-06-21 20:13:32

- Added repository-wide UTF-8/LF guidance in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added `.editorconfig` defaults for UTF-8, LF, and final newlines.
- Set Prettier `endOfLine` to `lf`; existing `.gitattributes` already normalizes text files to LF.
- Verified touched convention files have no BOM and no CRLF line endings.

## 2026-06-21 20:15:38

- Added `scripts/check-text-conventions.mjs` to validate staged text files for UTF-8 without BOM and LF line endings.
- Wired the text convention check into `.githooks/pre-commit` before validation.
- Added `pnpm run check:text` for manual invocation.
- Verification passed: `pnpm run check:text` and `node --check scripts/check-text-conventions.mjs`.

## 2026-06-21 20:34:43

- Checked GitHub CI for PR #6; `Validate / validate` failed on `prettier` and `spec-overview`.
- Ran Prettier on `CONTINUE.md`, `CONTINUE_LOG.md`, and `scripts/check-text-conventions.mjs`.
- Regenerated `specs/OVERVIEW.md` with `pnpm run specs:overview:update`.
- Focused verification passed: `pnpm run check:text` and Prettier check for the affected files.

## 2026-06-22 08:30:16

- Compared `C:\dev\resource-planning-codex` operational tooling with this template.
- Added Dockerized GoReleaser helper tooling for `starterctl` snapshots and release artifact installation scripts for POSIX and PowerShell.
- Added guarded PostgreSQL backup and restore scripts adapted to this repo's Compose defaults and Prisma PostgreSQL config.
- Updated `scripts/deploy.sh` to derive build metadata, take a pre-deploy PostgreSQL backup, optionally install CLI release artifacts, and restart app plus worker.
- Updated README and `.gitignore` for CLI release artifacts and PostgreSQL dump storage.
- Verification passed: `package.json` parse, PowerShell CLI release installer smoke test, and source-name scan for copied product strings. POSIX shell syntax checks could not run locally because this Windows host's `bash.exe` points at a broken WSL installation.

## 2026-07-09 16:06:10

- Compared `C:\dev\resource-planning-codex` CLI distribution with this template.
- Added authenticated `/api/downloads/cli`, `/api/downloads/cli/[target]`, and `/api/downloads/cli/checksums` routes backed by mounted `starterctl_*` release artifacts.
- Added CLI download controls to Settings > Tokens and wired Docker Compose to mount `CLI_RELEASES_HOST_DIR` at `CLI_RELEASES_DIR`.
- Added `test:mutation:critical` for CLI release lookup mutants.
- Verification passed: `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/cli-release-service.test.ts`, `pnpm run test:mutation:critical`, `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run check:text`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-07-09 21:06:39

- Included `AI_TESTING.md` in PR #9 and referenced it from `AGENTS.md`.
